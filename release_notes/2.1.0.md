# Jasmine Core 2.1.0 Release Notes

## Summary

This is the first pre-release of Jasmine 2.1.

## Features

- Support for focused specs via `fit` and `fdescribe`
- Support for `beforeAll` and `afterAll`
- Support for an explicit `fail` function
- Allow custom timeout for `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, `beforeAll`, `afterAll` and `it`
- Spies now track return values
- Testing in Node.js via the official Jasmine Node Module
- Spec results now have `suiteResults` method that behaves similarly to to `specResults`
- HtmlReporter shows error alerts for afterAllExceptions


## Bugs

- CI now works for IE8 (this was releated to `ConsoleReporter` below)
- Detect global object properly when getting the jasmine require obj
  - Fixes #569
  - [Tracker Story #73684570](http://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/73684570)

## Deprecations

- `ConsoleReporter` as part of Jasmine core

### `ConsoleReporter`

The Console Reporter exists nearly entirely for the old manner of running Jasmine's own specs in node.js. As we are now supporting node.js officially, this reporter code no longer needs to be in this repo and instead will be in the Jasmine npm.

For now you will see a deprecation message. It will be removed entirely in Jasmine 3.0.

## Documentation
